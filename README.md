# Solar - a space exploration web app of our solar system

[Live site](https://solar-exploration.web.app/)

A personal project I built with vanilla javascript. I used the three.js javascript library to build an interactive 3D render of our solar system. This is a single page web app designed to provide information about the beautiful planets of our solar system. Planetary data is sourced - via AJAX - from the [Solar Systen OpenData](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/) API.

## Technologies used:

- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Three.js javascript library
- The [Solar Systen OpenData](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/) API

## Features

- Users can navigate between planets using the navigation bar at the bottom of the page
- Get information on the planet by clicking on the blue `Info` button on the top right of the page
- Get more detailed information on the planet by clicking on the blue `More info` button (found in the info tab displayed after clicking the `Info` button)
- Users can enter their weight and age so they can see how much they would weigh and how old they are on each planet
